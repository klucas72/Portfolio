          <p>Born and raised in rural Illinois, I graduated high
            school and started college in the nearby college town
            of Terre Haute, Indiana. There I completed my Bachelor's
            of Science in Medical Technology. I interned at a
            hospital just outside of Chicago where I performed and
            ran laboratory tests ordered by physicians and nurses
            at area hospitals. Tired of the cold and harsh winters,
            I applied and was accepted as a United States Naval Medical
            Service Corps Officer in the United States Navy.
            For officer training school and indoctronation, I was
            sent to the Naval Training Center in Newport Rhode Island.
            From there, I was stationed in San Diego, California for
            one four year tour. I left the Navy after one tour and
            lived in San Diego for about 10 years before I moved to
            Atlanta. While in Atlanta, I went back to school and
            received another Bachelor's of Science in Network
            Communications and Engineering. With my combined
            experience as a Medical Technologist and a Network
            Engineer, I have been working for a Medical Device/Biomedical
            company here in Atlanta for the last 8 years. This position
            has allowed me to travel the world and work with citizens
            from various countries and cultures. Now, I am working
            on gaining experience and becoming a full stack developer
            where it will hopefully help me push my career forward
            to new and different areas of my life and work.</p>
