## Content

This week's homework submission is an updated profile web page.  Below are the web pages for my github profile, my LinkedIn profile page, and portfolio page.

Technologies used in the portfolio page include HTML and CSS.  Work examples and their link have HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Github profile:  https://github.com/klucas72
LinkedIn profile:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristopher-lucas-1467355/
Portfolio page:  https://klucas72.github.io/Portfolio/

My resume is attached inside the portfolio page and gives the option to download, if desired, via the web browser.
